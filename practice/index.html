          <p class="problem-p">
            The <a href="#"><em>history</em></a> of Yu-gi-oh! is a long one and,
            owing to that, Yu-Gi-Oh! went through many changes, for better of
            worse. Those in charge always had a few options regarding it's
            future, to change as little as possible, to make big changes or,
            probably the worst of all, to just let it be, a small game with a
            short development lifespan. They opted for, probably, the best
            option; big, <strong>innovative</strong> changes. The problem was,
            that no boundaries were set. It was always easier to just ban the
            <em>"problem"</em> cards, instead of changing them, which does make
            some sense, but all the bans are short lived: they disappear once
            new, stronger cards make their entrance. And power creep was never a
            consideration, it seems. Thus the games has many interesting
            concepts, mechanics, but ultimately they do not matter, as
            <em><strong>power</strong></em> is the only deciding factor. What is
            powerful changes over time, but only because Yu-Gi-Oh's power creep
            is nothing if not steady and predictable.
          </p>
          <h4 class="problems" id="problem-list">List of problems</h4>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>Too many cards which are completely useless</li>
            <p>
              Instead of incorporating cards into mechanics, and balancing them
              all together, new cards are just pumped out while old ones are
              forgotten and <em>"exiled"</em> from the game.
            </p>
            <li>
              Too many cards with, all things considered, same effects, which
              are the <em>current</em> powerefull effects.
            </li>
            <p>
              Goal of every <strong>Tier 0</strong> deck is to pump out as many
              powerful "Boss" monsters as possibles, which are characterised by
              effects that <em>negate</em> and give protection to them.
            </p>
            <li>Turn time</li>
            <p>
              In order to "pump out" those powerful monsters, a lot of comboing
              is necessary, which, in turn, takes a lot of time.
            </p>
            <li>
              The match time, or number of turns, is incredibly short, compared
              to the turn time. Most matches are over by turn 4 maximum.
            </li>

                  Just too simple and easy to splash in any deck, requiring only
                  4 cards total, 2 monster, a fusion spell, and the fusion
                  monster itself. With incredible ease of access support, Verte
                  Anaconda, its abillity to dodge any removal for itself or any
                  other card with it's quick effect, it's unbelievable recursion
                  during
                  <strong>every</strong> standby phase, it's just one of the
                  most annoying cards to play against.

                  Very long turns, and same long turns during
                  <strong>OPPONENT'S</strong> turn, an "infinite" amount of
                  normal summons, which are quite hard to deal with, and there
                  is no logic behind that many normal summons; it's just a
                  *bleep* jumping around the rules, so an archetype can compete

                  Again a small engine, which needs only one card to kickstart
                  it all, negate, protection, non-targeting non-destruction
                  removal, recursion. At least it needs more individual cards to
                  function, so it can be stopped easier. Not much to say, just
                  strong and boring to play against when it's in every deck.

          <p class="conclusion-p">
            In conlusion *bleep* this *bleep*. Probably the most generous Online
            TCG on the market. Plentiful early gems and packs, enough to create
            several decks of player's preference, and keep building up
            collection through daily quests, periodical events and ladder
            climbing. The downside is that it can be a very frustrating game
            when not playin meta decks, a problem which can be solved by adding
            more game modes; normal (non-ranked) matches, special formats
            ("Pure", limited rarity, limited cards, etc.) and such. All in all,
            a love-hate relationship.
